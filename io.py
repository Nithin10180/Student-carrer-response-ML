 our school system is not perfect, and almost students do not know about what they can do in our practical life, they have no dreams. Therefore, we are not successful.

I think educational institutes must develop the students' minds in such a crystal & clear way that students do not feel shyness in choosing a career of their own interest. A teacher builds a Strong-Mind(Bull-Head). So, the role of the teacher is important to produce a "Strong and Healthy Mind Nation."

They should offer career counseling to students, make sessions

There should be the need for career counselors who timely motivate the students to choose the right path

N/A

My opinion is that there is a career counseling team made by the government in every college and university to give the true direction about the future of students.

Very good opinion

Every educational institution should learn the students that any career is not wrong; it's totally dependent upon you, how much your struggle involves in achieving that career.

Institutes should arrange career counseling sessions for students

Only teach Students and make it effective

Test their skills

A perfect career counseling session to let the students select their profession according to their interest.

Yes

Must provide career counseling and guidance. They must aware students of the best opportunities for their career according to their skills.

Encourage passions of students

There must be some practical activities for students. Based on the interest of students in these activities, they must select their field.

There should be proper career counseling of a student before choosing their academic career.

After getting the admissions, there should be counseling sessions so if anyone makes their mind so he should easily switch.

According to my opinion, educational institutions should organize career counseling seminars and sessions, then invite successful and most dedicated personalities of this era to motivate its students.

FIRST OF ALL, every student has its own willing and parental pressure. But there are no concepts of career counseling in Pakistan schools and colleges. Therefore, the student does not take great achievements and success; they fall into failure. That's why... my suggestion is that in every school and college, there must be extra lectures about career counseling. Then the student will decide the right path, what they can do in their future...

There should be a career counseling program in schools and colleges because students face difficulties in choosing the right profession.

Educational institutions should offer career counseling and guidance programs.

Students' interests matter. What kind of field they choose

Sorry üòê

In my opinion, teachers should also guide job opportunities in this field.

There should be a keen and thorough counseling from the school level. Teachers should identify one's skills and encourage them to pursue whatever a student wants besides any pressure.

They should motivate students & tell them about the opportunities they can get.

Career counseling is today's basic need for every student to choose the best career.

Yes

..

Check students' interest and guide them

I think we need to strengthen our school system. If our base was strong, it helps us in our practical life, and we will succeed.
