Student Career Responses Analysis
This repository contains a Python script that analyzes student responses regarding their career choices, decision-making processes, and the role of educational institutions in guiding students. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and sentiment analysis.

Contents
Data Processing: The script reads a CSV file containing student responses, renames columns for clarity, and maps categorical responses to numerical values for analysis.
Data Visualization: It generates various visualizations, including histograms and pie charts, to represent the distribution of responses.
Sentiment Analysis: The script performs sentiment analysis on open-ended responses to gauge the overall sentiment regarding career counseling and decision-making.
Word Cloud Generation: A word cloud is created to visualize the most frequently mentioned terms in the open-ended responses.
